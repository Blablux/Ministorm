# minnow-redux

**minnow-redux** aims to be a clone of [minnow](https://wordpress.org/themes/minnow/)
with much of the minimalism that I aim for.

This may start as a child-theme, but if I ever find the time to dig up the code,
it might evolve in a full-featured theme (or in fact, a theme without much
features), as I crave for simplicity.

What this theme aims to modify:

+ as a child theme:
  + Reduce meta in posts (content & singles)
  + Modify footer to change links and add licence
+ as a full featured theme (someday):
  + Custom header image
  + Additional posts type
