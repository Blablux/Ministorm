# Ministorm

**Ministorm** is a slight variation of
[Minnow](https://wordpress.org/themes/minnow/) with some more minimalism and a
few features.

This started as a child-theme, but ended up as a full-featured theme (or in
fact, a theme without much features).

Changes from Minnow:

+ Reduce meta in posts (content & singles)
+ Change footer links and add licence
+ Remove emoji
+ Add some custom style
+ Changed caption style

All credits should go to *Automattic* as I didn't changed much of their Minnow
release.
